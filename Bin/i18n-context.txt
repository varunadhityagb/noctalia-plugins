Project Overview

Noctalia is a desktop shell for Linux (similar to Windows taskbar + system tray + control panel, or macOS menu bar + dock). It runs on Wayland compositors (Hyprland, Niri, Sway, etc.). The target audience is Linux enthusiasts who customize their desktop environment. The tone should be casual but precise — friendly yet technically accurate.

Placeholders — DO NOT Translate

Variables in curly braces are replaced at runtime. Keep {placeholder} syntax exactly as-is.
Example: "Batería al {percent}%" ✅ NOT "Batería al {porcentaje}%" ❌

HTML in Translations

Preserve HTML tags exactly: <br> (line break), <b>text</b> (bold), <i>text</i> (italic).

Do not add or remove any punctuations.

Capitalization Guidelines

- Sentence case for descriptions: "Enable dark mode when the sun sets."
- Title Case for labels/headers: "Audio Devices", "System Monitor"
- ALL CAPS only for acronyms: CPU, GPU, DNS, VPN, OSD, NSFW, SFW

Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Don't translate "Dark Mode" as "Night Mode" — they're different features
2. Don't translate "Bar" as "Toolbar" — it's specifically a status bar
3. Don't translate "Panel" as "Window" — panels are specific overlay UI elements
4. Don't translate "Widget" as "App" or "Plugin" — widgets are bar components
5. Don't translate "Toast" as "Notification" — toasts are ephemeral popups, notifications persist
6. Don't translate keyboard key names like "Caps Lock", "Num Lock", "Scroll Lock" if your locale commonly keeps them in English
7. Don't add honorifics or formal language — keep it casual and direct
8. Don't translate command examples like notify-send, systemctl poweroff, etc.
9. Don't translate file extensions like .qml, .json, .css, .el

Tone: Keep it casual and concise. Avoid overly formal or verbose phrasing.

Plural Forms

Strings ending in -plural are the plural variants. Use your language's plural rules.
For languages with multiple plural forms (Russian, Arabic, etc.), adapt accordingly.

Context Clues

- Keys ending in -description are helper text shown below inputs
- Keys ending in -label are form field labels
- Keys ending in -placeholder are input field placeholder text
- Keys ending in -tooltip are hover tooltips
- Keys under actions.* are action button labels
- Keys under common.* are shared/reused terms
